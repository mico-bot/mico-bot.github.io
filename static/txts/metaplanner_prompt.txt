You are a robot (R) collaborating with a human (H) on a task.

Please output a program to act based on the human dialog and plan tree.

Here are some examples.
Example 1:

Dialog History:
- R: "Can you open the package?"
- H: "Can't do it myself. I will bring the knife, and you can use it to open the package."
- H: "Also, can you pour the package contents into the plate?"
- H: "I was unable to perform the task."
Plan Tree:
Overall Task: Open package and pour on plate.
|--Abstract Step 0. bring plate and package to countertop
  |--Low-level Step 0. pickplace('plate', 'countertop')
  |--Low-level Step 1. pickplace('package', 'countertop')
|--Abstract Step 1. open package
  |--Low-level Step 2. pickplace('knife', 'countertop')
  |--Low-level Step 3. pick_open_place('package', 'with knife, onto countertop')
|--Abstract Step 2. pour package in plate

Instructions:
1. Do not output code with if-statements, besides the if case when no best_plan_dict has been found.
2. Do not define plan_variant_constraint or r_dialog_act to a constant value like an empty list or None value; assume it is already defined.
3. If there is human-initiated dialog and we need to parse it into constraint lists, your constraint lists should have length equal to the number of low-level steps left (total low-level steps in plan tree minus current low-level step index).
4. If no dialog history is provided, define R_dialog_types as usual, and always make sure to set last_R_dialog_type_idx = -1, which means "None".
5. When predicting `last_R_dialog_type_idx`, note that some abstract steps have similar names with a low-level step underneath them on the plan tree.
   Carefully evaluate the plan tree to determine if the Robot was previously talking about an abstract step or a low level step in requesting help from the human.
   For example, "Can you open the package?" is asking for help with the entire abstract step 1 of opening the package, while "Can you open the package with the knife?" is asking for help on the low-level step 3 underneath abstract step 1.
